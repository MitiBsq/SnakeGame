# SnakeGame
Project-->7

This is my seventh project where im testing my beginner javascript knowledge with a little bit of css and of course html5

The project theme is the "old-classic" game "Snake" where you have to eat some apples (points) to grow your length, but be careful, hitting the wall or eating your own tail will lead to loss.
